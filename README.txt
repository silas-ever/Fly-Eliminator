Fly Eliminator
By: Silas Ever

You are a hungry frog. Resources are scarce, so there are other hungry frogs who want your food. You must eat the flies before time runs out. The red fly is bigger and juicier than the black fly, so it will reduce your hunger by a larger amount.

Press start when you open the game and see the title screen in order to begin playing. Use the arrow keys to direct your frog. Press SELECT (backspace) at any time to return to the start screen.
