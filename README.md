# Fly Eliminator

This game was coded in C. Made for CS 2110 at Georgia Tech. 

The premise of the game is that you play as a hungry frog. Resources are scarce, so you must eat all of the flies before time runs out.

To play, press START (enter) when you open the game. Use the arrow keys to direct your frog towards the flies. Press SELECT (backspace) at any time to return to the start screen.
